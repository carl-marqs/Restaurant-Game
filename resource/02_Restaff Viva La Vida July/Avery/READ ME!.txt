Hello, this is Avery O/

Before you use my stuff you should know:
You need to own RMMV for everything besides the Icons. All is still bound to use in RPG Maker.

All credits go to Avery (and Kadokawa for the edited resources), you may use them in any non-commercial project, if you use them in a commercial one you have to send me a free copy instantly when it's out.
NO REPOST! NO POST OF EDITS! CREDITS MUST BE GIVEN!
